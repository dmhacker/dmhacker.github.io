In order to better\nincorporate the new blogging interface, my website underwent some pretty significant\ninternal changes, which I will discuss in my first ever post here!</p>\n<h4>Motivations</h4>\n<p>My motivations for creating a blog are actually pretty straightforward.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I think I have a lot to blog about, but I lacked a medium for it. I love learning\nnew things, and I would love to share insights that I’ve made with others who might\nbe interested in them. In addition, I wanted a (public) space where I could catalog\ntidbits of information that I’ve picked up over the years, so that that knowledge\nwouldn’t go to waste when I inevitably forget about it.</li>\n<li>I’ve always admired other technical content creators and their respective blogs.\nSome that come to mind are those of <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/\">Jeff Atwood</a>,\n<a href=\"https://thume.ca/\">Tristan Hume</a>, and <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/\">David Walsh</a>.\nEven companies these days are starting to maintain their own technical blogs:\n<a href=\"https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/\">Bloomberg</a> (where I worked as an intern),\n<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twosigma.com/insights/\">Two Sigma</a>,\n<a href=\"https://blog.janestreet.com/\">Jane Street</a>, to name a few.\nWhen designing my blog, I drew inspiration from many of these existing sites.</li>\n<li>It was the perfect time to do so. As part of my general education requirements\nat UCSD, I am required to take a class called <a href=\"https://sixth.ucsd.edu/cat/courses/cat-125/index.html\">CAT 125</a>,\nfocusing on improving our public rhetoric. The goals of the class and this blog\nlined up perfectly, so this will serve as an extremely useful, long-lasting final\nproject. Through immediate development of my blog, I am essentially killing two birds\nwith one stone.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Design Approach</h4>\n<p>In the past, one of the main things holding me back was the fact that I would\nhave to develop a lot of infrastructure if I wanted to blog effectively on my\nwebsite. When I designed the current iteration of my website two or so years\nago, I did not design it assuming that I would, in the future, want to be able\nto connect a blog to it.</p>\n<p>Well, actually, let me be more specific. I did design the interface to be as\nextensible as possible, and with regards to the UI, my website did not actually\nhave to change that much to accomodate the blog. However, the internals (my\ncodebase) would have to change dramatically to support the dynamic functionality\nthat blogging requires.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, the main constraint that my website faces is my reliance on\nGitHub Pages to host it. GitHub Pages cannot run web servers, which means that it\ncannot use dynamic content; it only serves static HTML files from the repository\nroot directory. I realize that the website, even as static HTML and JS files, could\nbe configured to load content in dynamically through API calls to some backend\n(or database like Firebase), but I wanted to keep everything entirely self-contained\nwithin GitHub Pages, such that I had no dependencies on external services. The tool\nthat I eventually choose allowed me to develop within these two criteria.</p>\n<h5>Before the Blog</h5>\n<p>I intentionally designed my website to be as minimal as possible, both structurally\nand visually. This means both minimizing the amount of content on the page,\nminimizing the number of pages, and minimizing the amount of vibrant colors used.\nThere are several advantages to this design philosophy: (1) you get faster page load\ntimes for free, (2) the muted, uniform color palette is easier on the eyes, and (3)\nvibrant colors can be used to highlight important information or otherwise point\nout critical sections to the user. Even with the blog now live, I like to think that\nI’ve still stayed true to these minimalist ideals.</p>\n<p>This is what the home page used to look like. That’s all the website really was.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/7f546/old-homepage.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.07599309153713%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQDBf/EABQBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAetlaJ1I/8QAGhAAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBBMUIP/aAAgBAQABBQLBCJXQ14eP/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPwE//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAGxAAAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABITMSIDH/2gAIAQEABj8CrFPkA9iFWOn/xAAcEAACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATFBECFRkfH/2gAIAQEAAT8hd3QJ73ggjyhyXj//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAECDP/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAwEBPxA//8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPxA//8QAHhABAAAFBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAQESExQVFhocH/2gAIAQEAAT8QA9iOaemx2B5lMVN9IWnmX//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Old Homepage\"\n        title=\"Old Homepage\"\n        src=\"/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/c739e/old-homepage.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/8ee9c/old-homepage.jpg 148w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/ebbe7/old-homepage.jpg 295w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/c739e/old-homepage.jpg 590w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/5413e/old-homepage.jpg 885w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/4efde/old-homepage.jpg 1180w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/7f546/old-homepage.jpg 2895w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Because of the website just had to support a single page with some assets, the\ncodebase was extremely small.

The main disadvantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every blog post follows a consistent ‘external’ template, maybe containing\nfeatures like a header, footer, and navbar. The only thing differing between\nblog posts is the content of the post itself. If I ever wanted to change the\nouter template, I would have to go through each blog post and update them\nmanually. </li>\n<li>HTML is tough to write long blogs in. The XML tags and extreme nesting\nstructure makes it hard to edit and easy to slip up. A much more natural\nchoice to develop blogs in is something like Markdown, which can be converted\nto HTML but abstracts away all of the tags. In fact, the post you are reading\nright now was <a href=\"https://github.com/dmhacker/dmhacker.github.io/blob/source/content/blog/blog-12-04-2019-starting-a-blog/index.md\">actually written in Markdown</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next step then was to replace the barebones HTML infrastructure with\nsomething that could support blogging, namely a <b>static site generator</b>.\nI won’t really go over the nuances behind static site generators, but if you’re\ninterested in learning more about them, David Welsh wrote\n<a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators\">a good blog post</a>\ndescribing their features, use case scenarios, advantages, and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>I choose to use a static site generator called <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a>. Gatsby allows people\nto write websites using their version of <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> and then compiles the JSX\nyou write into static HTML files. This flexibility is perfect for a blog,\nbecause it allows you to write posts in your scripting language of choice\n(like Markdown) and then, during compilation, convert the Markdown into\nan HTML AST dynamically, which can then be loaded into a JSX template. I’ve\nworked a fair amount with React in the past and was familiar with JSX so it\nmade Gatsby an easy choice for the static site generator. </p>\n<p>The one-to-one correspondence between JSX and HTML is pretty simple to spot.\nIn fact, well-formed HTML is essentially JSX in its simplest form. This\nmade the translation from my old website smooth at first: all I had to\ndo was transplant the body from my index.html file into an index page\ncomponent within Gatsby. The metadata in the head of the HTML I moved\nto a <a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">React Helmet</a> component.\nAdditionally, I was able to use the properties of JSX to shorten some of my\nrepetitive home page code, specifically with respect to my projects and\nvisualizations sections.</p>\n<p>Converting this stuff from HTML to JSX was rather tedious, and one of the\nreasons I put off this project for so long, but I am relieved that the\ntransition went by rather painlessly in the end.</p>\n<h5>Continuous Compilation</h5>\n<p>TODO</p>\n<h5>Blogging in Gatsby</h5>\n<p>TODO</p>\n<h4>Future Plans</h4>\n<p>TODO</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting My Own Blog","date":"December 04, 2019","description":"My motivations for and approach to creating a blog"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog-12-04-2019-starting-a-blog/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
