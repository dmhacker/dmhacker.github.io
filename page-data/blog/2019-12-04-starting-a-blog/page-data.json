In order to better…","html":"<p>It’s been a goal of mine to attach a blog to my personal website for a long time,\nand I’m happy to say that I finally got around to the task. In order to better\nincorporate the new blogging interface, my website underwent some pretty significant\ninternal changes, which I will discuss in my first ever post here!</p>\n<h4>Motivations</h4>\n<p>My motivations for creating a blog are actually pretty straightforward.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I think I have a lot to blog about, but I lacked a medium for it. I love learning\nnew things, and I would love to share insights that I’ve made with others who might\nbe interested in them. In addition, I wanted a (public) space where I could catalog\ntidbits of information that I’ve picked up over the years, so that that knowledge\nwouldn’t go to waste when I inevitably forget about it.</li>\n<li>I’ve always admired other technical content creators and their respective blogs.\nSome that come to mind are those of <a href=\"https://blog.codinghorror.com/\">Jeff Atwood</a>,\n<a href=\"https://thume.ca/\">Tristan Hume</a>, and <a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/\">David Walsh</a>.\nEven companies these days are starting to maintain their own technical blogs:\n<a href=\"https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/\">Bloomberg</a> (where I worked as an intern),\n<a href=\"https://www.blog.google/technology/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twosigma.com/insights/\">Two Sigma</a>,\n<a href=\"https://blog.janestreet.com/\">Jane Street</a>, to name a few.\nWhen designing my blog, I drew inspiration from many of these existing sites.</li>\n<li>It was the perfect time to do so. As part of my general education requirements\nat UCSD, I am required to take a class called <a href=\"https://sixth.ucsd.edu/cat/courses/cat-125/index.html\">CAT 125</a>,\nfocusing on improving my public rhetoric skills. The goals of the class and this blog\nlined up perfectly, so this will serve as an extremely useful, long-lasting final\nproject. Through immediate development of my blog, I am essentially killing two birds\nwith one stone.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Design Approach</h4>\n<p>In the past, one of the main things holding me back was the fact that I would\nhave to develop a lot of infrastructure if I wanted to blog effectively on my\nwebsite. When I designed the current iteration of my website two or so years\nago, I did not design it assuming that I would, in the future, want to be able\nto connect a blog to it.</p>\n<p>Well, actually, let me be more specific. I did design the interface to be as\nextensible as possible, and with regards to the UI, my website did not actually\nhave to change that much to accomodate the blog. However, the internals (my\ncodebase) had to change dramatically to support the dynamic functionality\nthat blogging requires.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, however, the main constraint that my website faces is my reliance on\nGitHub Pages to host it. GitHub Pages cannot run web servers, which means that it\ncannot use dynamic content; it only serves static HTML files from the repository\nroot directory. I realize that the website, even as static HTML and JS files, could\nbe configured to load content in dynamically through API calls to some backend\n(or database like Firebase), but I wanted to keep everything entirely self-contained\nwithin GitHub Pages, such that I had no dependencies on external services. The tool\nthat I eventually choose allowed me to develop within these two criteria.</p>\n<h5>Before the Blog</h5>\n<p>I intentionally designed my website to be as minimal as possible, both structurally\nand visually. This means both minimizing the amount of content on the page,\nminimizing the number of pages, and minimizing the amount of vibrant colors used.\nThere are several advantages to this design philosophy: (1) you get faster page load\ntimes for free, (2) the muted, uniform color palette is easier on the eyes, and (3)\nvibrant colors can be used to highlight important information or otherwise point\nout critical sections to the user. Even with the blog now live, I like to think that\nI’ve still stayed true to these minimalist ideals.</p>\n<p>This is what the home page used to look like. That’s all the website really was.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/7f546/old-homepage.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64.07599309153713%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Old Homepage\"\n        title=\"Old Homepage\"\n        src=\"/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/c739e/old-homepage.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/8ee9c/old-homepage.jpg 148w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/ebbe7/old-homepage.jpg 295w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/c739e/old-homepage.jpg 590w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/5413e/old-homepage.jpg 885w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/4efde/old-homepage.jpg 1180w,\n/static/d78aaf684de34ecc316af4f6b4fcba67/7f546/old-homepage.jpg 2895w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Because of the website just had to support a single page with some assets, the\ncodebase was extremely small.

The main disadvantages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Every blog post follows a consistent ‘external’ template, maybe containing\nfeatures like a header, footer, and navbar. The only thing differing between\nblog posts is the content of the post itself. If I ever wanted to change the\nouter template, I would have to go through each blog post and update them\nmanually. </li>\n<li>HTML is tough to write long blogs in. The XML tags and extreme nesting\nstructure makes it hard to edit and easy to slip up. A much more natural\nchoice to develop blogs in is something like Markdown, which can be converted\nto HTML but abstracts away all of the tags. In fact, the post you are reading\nright now was <a href=\"https://github.com/dmhacker/dmhacker.github.io/blob/source/content/blog/blog-12-04-2019-starting-a-blog/index.md\">actually written in Markdown</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next step then was to replace the barebones HTML infrastructure with\nsomething that could support blogging, namely a <b>static site generator</b>.\nI won’t really go over the nuances behind static site generators, but if you’re\ninterested in learning more about them, David Welsh wrote\n<a href=\"https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators\">a good blog post</a>\ndescribing their features, use case scenarios, advantages, and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>I choose to use a static site generator called <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a>. Gatsby allows people\nto write websites using their version of <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> and then compiles the JSX\nyou write into static HTML files. This flexibility is perfect for a blog,\nbecause it allows you to write posts in your scripting language of choice\n(like Markdown) and then, during compilation, convert the Markdown into\nan HTML AST dynamically, which can then be loaded into a JSX template. I’ve\nworked a fair amount with React in the past and was familiar with JSX so it\nmade Gatsby an easy choice for the static site generator. </p>\n<p>The one-to-one correspondence between JSX and HTML is pretty simple to spot.\nIn fact, well-formed HTML is essentially JSX in its simplest form. This\nmade the translation from my old website smooth at first: all I had to\ndo was transplant the body from my index.html file into an index page\ncomponent within Gatsby. The metadata in the head of the HTML I moved\nto a <a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">React Helmet</a> component.\nAdditionally, I was able to use the properties of JSX to shorten some of my\nrepetitive home page code, specifically with respect to my projects and\nvisualizations sections.</p>\n<p>Converting this stuff from HTML to JSX was rather tedious, and one of the\nreasons I put off this project for so long, but I am relieved that the\ntransition went by rather painlessly in the end.</p>\n<h5>Continuous Compilation</h5>\n<p>At this point, I’ve now written the JSX code that can be compiled down to\nHTML by Gatsby. But, now, how do we get GitHub Pages to show the\ncompiled HTML and not the source code? Recall that GitHub Pages is basically\na static web server that just maps the files in the repository directly to\nwebsite routes. It doesn’t perform any compilation, code execution, or\ndatabase queries.</p>\n<p>One solution is, after making a change to my Gatsby/JSX source code,\nI manually re-compile the codebase on my machine and then upload\nthe results to a separate branch that GitHub Pages can serve. However,\nthis solution has the dreaded word ‘manually’ as a part of it. Engineers\nshould never strive to do tasks manually, especially when they are easily\nautomated. In this case, the manual part is re-compiling and then uploading\ncompiled HTML files. I want a way to automate that portion, such that that step\noccurs automatically after I make a change.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I enlisted the help of a continuous integration service that has\nbeen integrated into GitHub. Normally, CI services are used for projects that\nhave unit tests to run, and whenever a change occurs in that project, the CI\nservice will automatically run the unit tests to make sure they still pass.\nIn my case, I wanted the CI service to ignore tests and instead re-compile\nmy JSX source code and then push the results to a branch that GitHub Pages\nrecognizes.</p>\n<p>To do this, I made use of <a href=\"https://travis-ci.com/\">TravisCI</a>, which is one of the more popular CI\nservices. Other notable continuous integration services include <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/\">Jenkins</a>\nand <a href=\"https://circleci.com/\">CircleCI</a>, both of which I have also used in other projects. Travis\nseemed like the most reasonable choice to me because they natively support\nGitHub pages integration using simple configuration directives:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">deploy:\n  local-dir: public\n  provider: pages\n  skip-cleanup: true\n  github-token: $GITHUB_TOKEN  \n  on:\n    branch: source\n  target_branch: master\n  keep_history: true</code></pre></div>\n<p>This tells Travis to monitor the <code class=\"language-text\">source</code> branch for commits and whenever\na commit is detected, re-compile and then push the build directory “public”\nto the <code class=\"language-text\">master</code> branch. The interface looks something like this:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/5db5b/travis-ci-interface.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 34.64528668610301%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"TravisCI Interface\"\n        title=\"TravisCI Interface\"\n        src=\"/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/c739e/travis-ci-interface.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/8ee9c/travis-ci-interface.jpg 148w,\n/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/ebbe7/travis-ci-interface.jpg 295w,\n/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/c739e/travis-ci-interface.jpg 590w,\n/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/5413e/travis-ci-interface.jpg 885w,\n/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/4efde/travis-ci-interface.jpg 1180w,\n/static/b5ac5d2a51a5775131786b41a0e67e53/5db5b/travis-ci-interface.jpg 2058w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>You can see that after every commit, the continuous integration server is\nnotified and triggers a rebuild.

Whenever I make a change\nto the <code class=\"language-text\">source</code> branch, the website will automatically update on GitHub Pages.\nIt’s finally time to add blogging functionality.</p>\n<h5>Blogging in Gatsby</h5>\n<p>It turns out that static site blogging using Gatsby is a pretty common paradigm (go figure).\nIt’s so common that Gatsby provides almost perfect out-of-the-box support for it. With a\nbit of tweaking, I was able to adapt this to work on my own site.</p>\n<p>The key to all of this can be found in the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">gatsby-starter-blog</a> repository.\nI suspected that the infrastructure in this starter blog was almost exactly what I\nneeded, and my hunch turned out to be correct. However, the starter blog meshes\nthis infrastructure with a lot of their own UI cruft, which I did not need. My task\nthus become separating out the necessary blogging components from the UI components\nand then incorporating the blogging components into my own website and rebuilding the UI.\nThis process was accomplished in the following manner.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the files and code that would remain mostly unchanged when moved to my repository.\nThis was the “gatsby-node.js” file (responsible for turning Markdown blog posts into GraphQL nodes)\nand then the GraphQL* queries themselves.</li>\n<li>Add the MarkdownRemark Gatsby plugin to my “gatsby-config.js” file. This loads the MarkdownRemark\nplugin and does the heavy lifting when it comes to converting Markdown posts to HTML abstract\nsyntax trees, which can then be loaded directly into my JSX components. The MarkdownRemark plugin\nalso had to be added via <code class=\"language-text\">yarn</code> to my Node dependencies list.</li>\n<li>Create the “src/templates/blog-post.js” file. This is the external template for each blog\npost mentioned earlier (contains things like a header and navigation bar). The template is\nused to bring a blog post to life.</li>\n<li>Create the “src/pages/blog.js” file. This is a centralized blog archive, a list of blog\nposts arranged in descending order by time. It allows for viewers to browse past blog posts.\nYou can find <a href=\"/blog\">this page here</a>.</li>\n<li>Integrate a minified version of the above list into the “src/pages/index.js” file. In the\nhome page, I wanted a small list of the 3 most recent blog posts as a subsection underneath the\nabout section.</li>\n<li>Create the folder “content/blog”. This is where all my blog posts would go.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><sup>*As an aside, GraphQL is a flexible query language developed alongside React by Facebook that\nGatsby incorporated into their build system. You can store data as GraphQL ‘nodes’ and then\naccess those nodes by making queries inside JSX components. This allows for data to be\ntransmitted effectively throughout the website; the data can come from a wide variety of\nsources, for example from directories or from a remote database.</sup></p>\n<p>With these steps completed, I had a working blog site. I then went about writing this post!</p>\n<h4>Future Plans</h4>\n<p>I am pretty satisfied with the current state of my website and blog.\nThe basics of a blog are all present: there’s a centralized list of posts, people\nare able to view a condensed version of the list from the home page, and posts are\ntagged with a unique slug generated from their file names. Additionally, the interface\nis consistent across both the blog and portfolio portions of my website, and everything\nstill remains both minimalist &#x26; modern.</p>\n<p>There is always room for improvement however. In the future, I would like to look into:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hooking an RSS feed up to my blog so news aggregators can track posts.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">Adding comment sections so that anonymous users can provide feedback on blog posts.\nConsidering using <a href=\"https://www.remarkbox.com/\">Remarkbox</a> to do this.</span> Done as of 12/05/2020.</li>\n<li>Enabling keyword tagging in blog posts, similar to tags in YouTube videos.</li>\n<li>Creating a search feature that searches posts by content, keywords, titles, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before tackling these updates, I hope to, foremost, continue writing blog posts in a\nconsistent fashion. My goal is write at least one post every week or at minimum, biweekly.\nSince each post takes around 3-6 hours for me to write, this should be a reasonable\namount of work.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this (long) article. Until next time!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting My Own Blog","date":"December 04, 2019","description":"My motivations for and approach to creating a blog"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/2019-12-04-starting-a-blog/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020-05-26-path-tracing-part-i/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Realistic Path Tracing (part I)"}}}}}
