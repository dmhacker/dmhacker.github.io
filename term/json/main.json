I regularly participate in online AI competitions, namely RobotGame and Vindinium. Also, I am proficient in Linux server administration and database management.\n\nOtherwise, I enjoy biking and jogging frequently as well as hiking. I'm currently a Life Scout, one rank below the highest rank of Eagle. As for school, I attend Westlake High School in California. I work [mainly] as a writer at the high school yearbook.\n\nFor forums and other online accounts, I often go by the name of dmhacker."
